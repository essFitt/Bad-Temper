Please note that the board is not designed to be used with a base plate. I have added a base plate STL file in case anyone wants to edit the PCB to make it work. 
I have found that the switches fit so nicely into the PCB that I do not need a switch plate. They are very snug with no wobble and no chance they will come loose unless deliberately made to do so. 
A case file cas been added. This is press-fitted and the layerlines do a good job at keeping the case secured. The case can be used to better position silicon feet or tenting solutions.
